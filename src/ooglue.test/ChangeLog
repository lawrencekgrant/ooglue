	* SqliteAccessTests.cs: Updated SQL for the table creation,
	  added an auto-increment primary key, the delete and update
	  tests were failing because there was no primary key.
	Changed my comparison in SelectRecordsTest from .AreSame,
	  which is for references to AreEqual, which is for value
	  types
